The sudo command is a command line utility in Linux to run a command as a
different user, depending on your privileges. 

The syntax is: 

sudo -u <user> command

Usually this is done to run command with elevated (root) privileges. In that
case you can just run sudo without specifying the user.

To list your own sudo privileges you can run sudo -l.
